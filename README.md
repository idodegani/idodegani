Hi there, I'm Ido Degani ðŸ‘‹
About Me
ðŸŽ“ I hold a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, with a specialization in Data Science.

ðŸ’¡ I'm an expert in machine learning, deep learning, and data engineering â€” with hands-on experience using PyTorch, scikit-learn, SQL, and cloud-native tools.

ðŸ§  I'm especially passionate about Generative AI (GenAI) and the latest breakthroughs in LLMs, multimodal models, vector databases, and AI infrastructure. I regularly experiment with state-of-the-art models like GPT, Llama, and Mistral, and I stay up-to-date with the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.

ðŸš€ I'm currently looking to join a fast-moving startup or team focused on solving real-world problems using AI, with a strong focus on productization and applied machine learning.

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not building with AI, you'll probably find me out surfing ðŸŒŠ â€” I find the ocean is the best place to clear my head and spark ideas.
