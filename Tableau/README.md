| Project Name | Description | Tableau Dashboard |
|---|---|---|
| 🎬 Netflix Content Review | I created a Tableau dashboard to analyze recent trends in Netflix movies and TV content. I designed an interactive chart that allows users to explore the data and uncover insights in a fun and engaging way. With this project, I demonstrate the power of Tableau in presenting complex information in a clear and intuitive way. | [Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ido.degani/viz/NetflixContentReview/Netflix) |
